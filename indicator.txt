Indicator buttons can have the following dynamic properties

diameter type Int
right_offset type Int
top_offset type Int
on_color type Color
off_color type Color

Offsets are from the edge of the button so if you have a border add the width
to your offsets.

Offsets must be 1 or more, an offset of 0 gets the default offset
